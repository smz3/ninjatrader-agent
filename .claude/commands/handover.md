Wrap up this session so the next session (or the next agent picking this repo back up) can pick up cleanly. Do these in order:

1. **Save uncommitted work.** Run `git status`. If there are changes worth keeping and it's safe to do so (not a mid-experiment broken state), commit and push them via `git_safe.py commit` and `git_safe.py push --yes --session <this session's id>` per the established auto-push policy. If it's unclear whether the state is safe to commit, say so and ask rather than guessing.

2. **Sync the tasks table.** This is the source of truth for cross-session work items - not the handover's prose. For anything that changed status this session:
   - New work item surfaced that isn't done yet -> `python .claude/scripts/db.py task-add --title "..." --category infra|app --priority 1-4 --details "..."`
   - Something got resolved, decided against, or finished -> `python .claude/scripts/db.py task-status --id N --status closed|rejected --note "..."` (note explains the outcome/why, gets appended not overwritten)
   - Still being worked through with the user, not yet resolved -> `--status discussing`
   Before adding a new task, run `task-list` first and check by meaning (not title text) whether an open/discussing task already covers it - a root cause found while investigating task N is usually an update to task N, not a new task.
   Do not just describe next steps in prose and skip this step - prose in a handover gets silently superseded by the next handover; tasks persist until explicitly closed/rejected.

3. **Write the handover.** Based on your own read of this conversation, determine:
   - **Summary** - what actually happened/changed this session (code written, decisions made, commits/pushes done).
   - **Next steps** - can reference tasks by id now that they're tracked (e.g. "see task #3"), doesn't need to re-explain everything in prose.
   - **Open questions** - anything unresolved that needs the user's input.

   Don't ask the user to restate anything you can already tell from the conversation. If nothing of substance happened this session, say that plainly instead of padding out a summary.

4. **Log it:**

   ```
   python .claude/scripts/db.py log --session <this session's id> --summary "..." --next "..." --questions "..."
   ```

5. **Confirm to the user**, in 1-2 sentences, that the handover is logged and it's safe to close this session now. Remind them that closing the session itself is still their action - you can't do it for them.
